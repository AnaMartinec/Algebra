                <ul>
                    <li>350 self-raising flur, and a little spare for dusting</li>
                    <li>1/4 tablespoon salt</li>
                    <li>1 tsp baking powder</li>
                    <li>85g butter, cut into cubes</li>
                    <li>3 tbsp caster sugar</li>
                    <li>175ml milk</li>
                    <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>
                    <li>squeeze lemon juice (see Know-how below)</li>
                    <li>beaten egg, to glaze</li>
                    <li>jam and clotted cream, to serve</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Method</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the oven to 220 degrees (or gas mark 7). Tip the flour into a large bowl along with the salt and bakin powder, then mix it all up. Add the butter in, then rub the butter in with your fingers until the mix looks like fine crumbs. When that is done, stir in the sugar.</li>
                    <li>Put the mil into a jub and heat in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. It should be warm but not hot. Add the vanilla and lemon juice to the mild and then put that to one side and put a bakin tray in the oven to warm.</li>
                    <li>Make a well in the dry mix, then add the liquid and combine it quickly with a cutlery knife - it will seem pretty wet at first. Spread some flour onto the work surface and tip the dough out. Dredge the dough over 2-3 times until it's smoother. Now pat it into a round shape about 4cm deep.</li>
                    <li>Take a 5cm cutter (Pro-tip - smooth edged cutters tend to cut more cleanly, giving it a better rise) and dip it into some flour. Plunge into the dough, then repeat until you have four scones. By this point you'll probably need to press what's left of the dough back into a round to cut out another four.</li>
