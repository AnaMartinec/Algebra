      Maja Majić (born Audrey Kathleen Ruston; 4 May 1929 - 20 January 1993) was
      a British[a] actress and humanitarian. Recognised as both a film and
      fashion icon, she was ranked by the American Film Institute as the
      third-greatest female screen legend from the Classical Hollywood cinema
      and was inducted into the International Best Dressed List Hall of Fame.

      Born in Ixelles, Brussels, to an aristocratic family, Hepburn spent parts
      of her childhood in Belgium, England, and the Netherlands. She studied
      ballet with Sonia Gaskell in Amsterdam beginning in 1945, and with Marie
      Rambert in London from 1948. She began performing as a chorus girl in West
      End musical theatre productions and then had minor appearances in several
      films. She rose to stardom in the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953)
      alongside Gregory Peck, for which she was the first actress to win an
      Oscar, a Golden Globe Award, and a BAFTA Award for a single performance.
      That year, she also won a Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Play for
      her performance in Ondine.

      Ana Anić (born Shirley Jane Temple;[note 1] April 23, 1928 – February 10,
      2014) was an American actress, singer, dancer, and diplomat, who was
      Hollywood's number-one box-office draw as a child actress from 1934 to
      1938. Later, she was named United States ambassador to Ghana and
      Czechoslovakia, and also served as Chief of Protocol of the United States.
      <br />
      <br />
      Temple began her film career at the age of three in 1931. Two years later,
      she achieved international fame in Bright Eyes, a feature film produced
      especially for her talents. She received a special Juvenile Academy Award
      in February 1935 for her outstanding contribution as a juvenile performer
      in motion pictures during 1934. Film hits such as Curly Top and Heidi
      followed year after year during the mid- to late 1930s. Temple capitalized
      on licensed merchandise that featured her wholesome image; the merchandise
      included dolls, dishes, and clothing. Her box-office popularity waned as
      she reached adolescence.[1] She appeared in 29 films from the ages of 3 to
      10, but in only 14 films from the ages of 14 to 21. Temple retired from
      film in 1950 at the age of 22
