    <h1>Paris</h1>
    <p>
        Paris (English: /ˈpærɪs/; French pronunciation: ​[paʁi] (listen)) is the capital and most populous city of France, with an estimated official population of 2,102,650 residents as of 1 January 2023[2] in an area of more than 105 km² (41 sq mi),[5] making it the fourth-most populated city in the European Union as well as the 30th most densely populated city in the world in 2022.[6] Since the 17th century, Paris has been one of the world's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, gastronomy, and science. For its leading role in the arts and sciences, as well as its very early system of street lighting, in the 19th century it became known as "the City of Light".[7] Like London, prior to the Second World War, it was also sometimes called the capital of the world.
