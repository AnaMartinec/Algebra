    <h1>London</h1>
    <p>
      London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom,
      with a population of just under 9 million.[1] It stands on the River
      Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary down
      to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia.[9]
      The City of London, its ancient core and financial centre, was founded by
      the Romans as Londinium and retains its medieval boundaries.[note 1][10]
      The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for
      centuries hosted the national government and parliament. Since the 19th
      century,[11] the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around
      this core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex,
      Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire,[12] which since 1965 has largely
      comprised Greater London,[13] which is governed by 33 local authorities
      and the Greater London Authority.
